# public-message-pinboard

This is a mobile web-app I built, although it can be used entirely as a website too. It is a completely functional and unique pinboard that uses a database to store the items, which allows it to sync across multiple devices.

That makes it perfect to share in households; you can share information from events coming up, to what you're planning on eating for dinner. It can also be used in an office setting. The original concept behind this project was to receive endorsements from colleagues, which would boost morale. 

I personally use my own version of this in my house but if you want to test out a public one I made, you can do so here: https://rishipublicpinboard.netlify.app (FYI double tap to delete an item)

I added some examples to demonstrate how this can be used within a family, but this is completely public and open. Feel free to try it out!

As always, let me know any feedback you have.

Enjoy!

P.S. If you use this site, messages can get added and deleted by other people testing it out.


There are steps below on how to add it to your homescreen, so feel free to try it out.

iOS: Press share, then scroll down and press add to home screen. 
N.B. It won't show up in the App Library, however, it will show up if you search for it. 

Android: Press the three dots in the top right corner (menu button), and press add to home screen.
